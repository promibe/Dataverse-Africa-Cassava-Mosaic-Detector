    Welcome to the Cassava Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission in the Dataverse Research Institute is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect if it has the cassava mosaic diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the *Cassava Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

        #### About Dataset
        This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset used in the Project was provided by Dataverse Africa Research Institute. This dataset consists of about 15K rgb images of healthy and diseased cassava leaves which is categorized into 3 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 70, 20, 10 ratio of training, validation, and testing set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 2077 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
        #### Content
        1. Training samples: 9939
        2. Validation samples: 3909
        3. Test samples: 2077
